*autohide.vim*

A simple plugin to set the "hidden" filesystem attribute on a
Windows system for files created by Vim. By default only nuisance files
created by Vim automatically due to user settings are hidden. The user can
configure the plugin to hide more files automatically, even files directly
created by the user.

*g:autohide_types* (default suv)
  b = backup files (currently doesn't work with 'backupdir')
  s = swap files
  u = undo files
  v = viminfo
  p = files matching pattern

*g:autohide_file_list* (default [.*])
  This is a wildcard, not a regular expression. So the default .* matches not
  "any characters" but rather "file names starting with a . character". Set
  this option to a |List| of wildcards for files you want Vim to hide while
  you are editing.
