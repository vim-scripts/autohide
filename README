A simple plugin to set the "hidden" filesystem attribute on a
Windows system for files created by Vim. By default only nuisance files
created by Vim automatically due to user settings are hidden. The user can
configure the plugin to hide more files automatically, even files directly
created by the user.

There are three options for the autohide plugin:

*g:autohide_types* (default "suv")
  b = backup files (currently doesn't work with 'backupdir')
  s = swap files
  u = undo files
  v = viminfo
  p = files matching pattern

*g:autohide_file_list* (default [.*])
  List of file patterns to hide when 'p' is part of |g:autohide_tipes|.
  This is a wildcard, not a regular expression. So the default .* matches not
  "any characters" but rather "file names starting with a . character". Set
  this option to a |List| of wildcards for files you want Vim to hide while
  you are editing.

*g:autohide_max_wait_for_write* (default 2)
  Maximum number of seconds to wait for the file being hidden to become
  writable before giving up. Useful for network file systems where the undo
  file especially may take a while to show as writable. Set to zero or less to
  never wait.

There is also one public function if you want to hide files in ways the plugin
doesn't support yet:

Autohide_DoHide({file})                                     *Autohide_DoHide()*
  Sets the "hidden" filesystem attribute on {file}. Will properly escape the
  file name before shelling out, so you shouldn't need to do that yourself.
